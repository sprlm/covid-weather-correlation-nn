# covid-weather-correlation-nn
Python code that aimed to find if various parameters related to weather such as wind speed, precipitation, and many others had any relationship to the number of Covid cases. Both a fuzzy logic and neural network model were created to see which would perform better. The datasets are not included in this repository but were acquired from the Department of Health and PAGASA. This was made as a requirement for university.
